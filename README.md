- this project is about a website for our university ISIMM

- the home page has general informations about ISIMM and it's accessible for all users

- to access to the admin page all u have to do is write "admin" with ur keyboard when u r in the home page (exactly like the konami code)

- same thing with the student page , just write "etudiant" in the home page

- we did it like the konami code because we didn't want the normal user to be able to find it easily , like putting the admin and student page in a button or in the menu bar in the home page.

  No we wanted it kinda hidden.

- after writing "admin" u will get a login page , if u enter a student's username and password u will get a customised 403 error page

- if u log in with the right admin username and password u will get to the admin page

- the admin can :

  . manage the students : add a student , edit a student , delete a student , check the students list , search for a student , add the marks of students , add the timetables of students

  . manage the accounts : create a student's account , delete a student's account , edit a student's account , check the list of all accounts ( the admin is the one responsible for the registration of the

  students. the students shouldn't be able to register themselves so the admin create their accounts and gives them the username and password in real life or by email (this is a way to prevent normal users from

  registration))

  . manage the news (the updates) : add a new , delete a new , edit a new , check the news list , check the notifcations (in the notifications the admin will find the messages sent by normal users from the

  "contact us" in the menu bar of the home page
